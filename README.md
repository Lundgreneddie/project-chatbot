# Bro-Bot (chatbot assignment)

We were to build a chatbot, using html, css but mainly Javascript.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We had problems basically with where to start, and getting working buttons and the questions to pop up after the user input. 

We used the pizza-bot demo to go over the code and try to work out how it was built. About the buttons and user input we took the help from our teammates, on many late nights.
